Project Name(s):  

    - Observer  
    - WeatherStation  
    - WeatherViewer  


Purposes:  

    - Learn to implement the cannonical GoF Observer Design Pattern.  
    - Learn to create a .dll  
    - Learn to apply the Observer pattern to existing code.  
    - Learn to provide an API and documentation to another programmer.  
    - Learn to provide citation for patterns.  


Specification:  

    - Create an empty Visual Studio solution named CST276SRS01.  
    - Delete the CST276SRS01 project from your solution and repository.  

    - Create a console project named Observer.  
    - Implement the Observer pattern from the GoF as shown in the UML Class Diagram (p294)  
    - Don't forget: Pattern citation is required for all projects, including this one.  

    - Create a .dll project named WeatherStation.  
    - Implement the WeatherStation namespace code in the WeatherStation.dll project.  
    - Find all the "TODO"s and follow the instructions given to get you started converting the code to use the Observer pattern.  
    - Create an API document for your .dll interface.  

    - Obtain the WeatherStation.dll and API document from your previous partner and give your WeatherStation.dll and API document to your next partner.  

    - Create a console project named WeatherViewer.  
    - Implement the WeatherViewer namespace code in the WeatherViewer project.  
    - Test your WeatherViewer with the WeatherStation.dll and API documentation provided from your previous partner.  

    - See the main.cpp example for a starting place to create your WeatherViewer.  
    - Unlike the main.cpp, your WeatherViewer should only report changes to the weather.  

    - As always, write a report for your project in the REPORT.md file.  

    - Be sure to follow all course guidelines, especially submission of main.cpp, REPORT.md, and README.md files.
